# Solarized Light for Git Bash

This is a fork of mavnn's [mintty-colors-solarized](https://github.com/mavnn/mintty-colors-solarized). Mavnn's colorschemes are renamed into `solarized_dark_default` and `solarized_light_default` and stored in `solarized_default`.

`solarized_light` is my forked theme. It is a mixture of two colorschems for Git Bash. The most part comes from `Solarized`, as mentioned above. However, both `White` & `BoldWhite` are the same as `Solarized`'s `ForegroundColour`. `Green` & `BoldGreen` are the same and are taken from [Nord](https://github.com/nordtheme/mintty).
